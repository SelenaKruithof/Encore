And that is exactly what we are trying to bring to our site. It's a space for people who want more, not just shows but stories, drama and more of everything. Naming the site âEncoreâ reflects this ongoing engagement that we are after. It's a call for more performances, even when after the stage goes dark. </p>

                          <p> Our logo is styled simply and intentionally in Courier Prime. This is because it gives of that trending vintage look of a classic typewriter font, which is seen in scripts for screenplays. This simplicity reflects our brands values of open information and easy access for anyone. It's a timeless font that is both classic and comforting to the eye.
                            <br> We also created a logo mark which is very expressive and artistic to show we still want to keep that classy look.

                          <p> In a world where people are numbed by never-ending screens and digital moments, Encore believes in the irreplaceable power of live theatre, the laughter, the gasps,  the shared stillness. We acknowledge that storytelling isnât just amusement; it holds the power to reconnect us to the world, each other, and ourselves. By reigniting presence and empathy, only then do we ignite something meaningful: the urgent need to feel, to be seen, and to truly belong.</p>
                          <h4 id="content-4" class="mt-2">Brand Value</h4>
                          <p> Accessibility: Making the theatre experience available to everyone with seamless ticketing and inclusive options. Ensuring that everyone, regardless of background or ability, can enjoy and participate in theatre.

                              <h3>Justification of Brand Persona:</h3>
                              <p>
                                For the Brand persona, we decided to not pick the obvious theatre lovers who are experts on where to find what but to target the people who are new to this theatre interest and would like more clarification, which is a large amount of people. 
                                The European Theatre Convention states:
                                <em>âMany European theatres lack separate budgets for marketing and communication, leading to limited use of traditional print media like brochures or programs. As a result, audiences often rely on fragmented sources such as friends, prior visits, or basic digital communication via theatre websites.â</em>
                                But because we can not check if these sources from friends or prior visits are real or what if people do not have any friend or family connections to theatre, where do they find their information?
                                We summarized all of these problems in the theatre community and created the following pain points:
                              </p>
                            
                              <ul>
                                <li>
                                  <strong>Complex Dramaturgy:</strong> Audience members reported confusion and irritation with theatre performances that presented simple stories in overly complicated ways, leading to fragmented engagement. (Audience Development Study, n.d.)
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                  <strong>Speculative Ticketing:</strong> Brokers exploit theatre fans by advertising tickets they donât own, often leading to invalid purchases or inflated prices (e.g., tickets resold at 5x face value). (Duncan & Duncan, 2021) and (Izundu, 2025)
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                  <strong>Fragmented Promotion:</strong> The absence of centralized hubs for theatre information forces audiences to rely on unreliable sources, hindering discovery of indie productions. (Professional, 2024)
                                </li>
                              </ul>
                            
                              <p>
                                For the apps we used the average apps people use from that age range and where they are most active. 
                                The target audience is not as active on Ticketmaster as Instagram and TikTok but since it is a ticketing platform that puts everything in one app we wanted to create the same concept as them, 
                                having all theatre plays in one reliable website with all information. Instagram's largest age group is 18-24 years old, making up 31.7% of users. 
                                TikTok's user base includes a significant portion of young adults, with 25% of US users aged 18-24 (Sheikh, 2025).

                                      <em>I started with this soft gray as my primary background color. Pure white felt too stark and sterile, but this shade adds a bit of warmth and subtlety without stealing the spotlight from the bolder colors.

                                      <em>This brown adds depth and a grounded feel to the design. I liked using it for shadow borders, or background areas where I wanted contrast but didnât want to jump straight to black. Itâs a nice in-between that keeps things cohesive, especially alongside the reds. Makes the white and greys pop out.</em>

                                      <em>Black is classic and powerful, so I reserved it for elements that needed serious impact like headlines, important buttons, and bold visual anchors. It gives the whole design a strong foundation and adds a touch of theatrical drama, which ties perfectly into the theme of the site.</em>

                                      <em>This is the color that really captures the essence of theatre for us. Itâs rich and intense, like red velvet curtains or stage lighting. I use it for things like text highlights and most of the important messages we try to highlight for the user, like in the FAQ.</em>

                                      <em>To energize the site and draw attention to key areas, I brought in this brighter red.

                                      <strong>IBM Plex Mono:</strong> We decided to use this font because it reminded us most of Times New Roman. A font that every student has worked with a lot and likes, which aligns best with our interview research.

                                      <strong>Courier Prime:</strong> Used in our logo that is styled simply and intentionally in Courier Prime. This is because it gives that trending vintage look of a classic typewriter font, which is seen in scripts for screenplays. This simplicity reflects our brands' values of open information and easy access for anyone. It's a timeless font that is both classic and comforting.

                                      <strong>Herr Von Muellerhoff:</strong> Used in our logo mark. This one was all about adding a personal, artsy touch when we were first starting out. Super elegant, kinda fancy, and gives off creative energy. Even though weâve moved toward a cleaner look, itâs part of our brandâs origin story, that early spark of expression and individuality.

                            <p>With these visuals, we wanted to create a warm and inviting atmosphere that immediately welcomes the user into the world of Encore. The aesthetic is intentionally chosen to reflect the essence of classical theatre, rich in emotion, tradition, and storytelling, while of course also feeling refined and modern. Warm tones, elegant typography, and expressive imagery work together to evoke that sense of sophistication and comfort. This blend of warmth and elegance sets the tone not only for the userâs journey through the site but also mirrors the kind of experience they can expect within the theatre itself.

                              <li>By the 30th of April, we aim to expose at least 100 people to our brand through our newly launched website, which is designed specifically for theater lovers. Our platform addresses key frustrations that audiences face, like struggling to secure last-minute tickets for popular shows, difficulty discovering smaller productions, and the challenge of finding accurate, up-to-date show schedules and recommendations. By providing a user-friendly experience with real-time ticket availability, current show listings, and reliable performance insights, we empower theatergoers but also non theatergoers to make informed choices effortlessly. Our goal is to make live theater more accessible, visible, and engaging for all. Success will be measured through website traffic, unique visitors, time spent on the site, and engagement with key features. Our platform will provide:</li>
                            
                              <ul>
                                <br>
                                <li><strong>Ticket Availability:</strong> By partnering with popular ticket providers and integrating real-time availability, users will be able to easily access seats for both popular and smaller shows, even at the last minute. We will ensure that our website displays the most up-to-date ticketing information, making it the go-to source for theatergoers looking for quick and reliable access.</li>
                                <li><strong>Discoverability of International</strong> and Smaller Productions: Our website will feature an exclusive section dedicated to promoting international productions and smaller, lesser-known performances that are often overlooked by mainstream platforms. Through curated listings and tailored recommendations, we aim to expose audiences to diverse theater experiences they might not discover elsewhere.</li>
                                <li><strong>Accurate Show Information</strong>: We will work closely with theaters and production companies to maintain an up-to-date database of show schedules, venue details, and relevant show information. Additionally, our website will provide helpful filters and a search function to allow users to quickly find shows that match their preferences. This ensures a streamlined, stress-free experience for our visitors, saving them time and frustration.</li>

                              <li>We as a brand decided to not only use Instagram's long-known popularity, but also TikTok with its uprising and ongoing success. In general, we will measure our campaign's results from a timespan of four weeks. We decided to create an objective for a whole month since it gives us as a brand a clearer long-term vision and more space to adapt and grow. A month provides enough time to build consistency, track our progress, and make adjustments without constantly resetting goals every week. We chose a rather high number in our reach objectives for Instagram since Instagram has great engagement potential e.g. they have a strong user base for visual content. Since TikTok is still in the process of expanding across all e.g. demographics and isnât as widely used as Instagram, we decided to decrease the amount of people Encore would like to reach through TikTok since its not as popular as Instagram. For measurements, we used the analytics which Instagram and TikTok provide.</li>
